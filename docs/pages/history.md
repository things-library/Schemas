## Overview

The Things Library was inspired by a simple but effective maintenance tracking system my father used for years. He maintained detailed records for small engines; lawn mowers, chain saws, snow blowers, etc; using index cards, with each card dedicated to a specific piece of equipment. He would document maintenance activities, part replacements, and service dates on these cards.

This practical approach to tracking maintenance history revealed a broader need: a standardized way to capture and organize information about any durable good. The Things Library schema was created to address this need, providing a universal structure for recording details about physical items and their maintenance requirements. For example, tracking when an HVAC air filter was last replaced and setting reminders for future replacements helps maintain system efficiency and extends equipment lifespan.
